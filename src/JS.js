const initialFlashcardQuestions = [
    { id: "js_1", deckId: "javascript_fundamentals", title: SUB_CATEGORY_TITLE, front: "What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?", back: "The == operator performs a loose equality comparison, which means it will try to coerce the operands to the same type before comparing them (e.g., 5 == '5' is true). The === operator performs strict equality, meaning it compares both the value and the type without any type coercion (e.g., 5 === '5' is false)." },
    { id: "js_2", deckId: "javascript_fundamentals", title: SUB_CATEGORY_TITLE, front: "Explain what 'hoisting' is in JavaScript.", back: "Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of their current scope before code execution. This means you can use a variable or function before it's declared. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations. For variables declared with var, they are initialized with undefined." },
    { id: "js_3", deckId: "javascript_fundamentals", title: SUB_CATEGORY_TITLE, front: "What is a closure in JavaScript?", back: "A closure is a feature where an inner function has access to the variables and parameters of its outer (enclosing) function, even after the outer function has finished executing. This allows for creating private variables and stateful functions." },
    { id: "js_4", deckId: "javascript_fundamentals", title: SUB_CATEGORY_TITLE, front: "Describe the difference between var, let, and const.", back: "var: Has function scope, is hoisted, and can be re-declared and updated.\nlet: Has block scope ({}), is hoisted but not initialized (creating a 'temporal dead zone'), and can be updated but not re-declared.\nconst: Has block scope, is hoisted but not initialized, and cannot be updated or re-declared after assignment." },
    { id: "js_5", deckId: "javascript_fundamentals", title: SUB_CATEGORY_TITLE, front: "What is the Event Loop and how does it work?", back: "The Event Loop is a concurrency model that allows JavaScript, a single-threaded language, to handle asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it takes the first event from the queue and pushes it onto the stack to be executed." },
    { id: "js_6", deckId: "javascript_fundamentals", title: SUB_CATEGORY_TITLE, front: "Explain what a Promise is and its three states.", back: "A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Its three states are:\nPending: The initial state; neither fulfilled nor rejected.\nFulfilled: The operation completed successfully.\nRejected: The operation failed." },
    { id: "js_7", deckId: "javascript_fundamentals", title: SUB_CATEGORY_TITLE, front: "What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?", back: "Both are web storage APIs, but localStorage persists data even after the browser is closed and reopened, with no expiration time. sessionStorage stores data only for the duration of the page session; the data is cleared when the tab or browser is closed." },
    { id: "js_8", deckId: "javascript_fundamentals", title: SUB_CATEGORY_TITLE, front: "How does the 'this' keyword work, and how is it different in arrow functions?", back: "In a regular function, the value of 'this' is determined by how the function is called (the call-site). In an arrow function, 'this' is lexically scoped, meaning it inherits the 'this' value from its surrounding (enclosing) scope at the time of its creation." },
    { id: "js_9", deckId: "javascript_fundamentals", title: SUB_CATEGORY_TITLE, front: "What is the DOM (Document Object Model)?", back: "The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page's structure as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document (like an element or a text node). JavaScript can use the DOM to manipulate the content, structure, and style of a webpage." },
    { id: "js_10", deckId: "javascript_fundamentals", title: SUB_CATEGORY_TITLE, front: "Explain what async/await is.", back: "async/await is syntactic sugar built on top of Promises that makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code, making it easier to read and write. The async keyword makes a function return a Promise, and the await keyword pauses the function's execution until the awaited Promise is settled." }
