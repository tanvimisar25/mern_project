    { id: "fe_1", deckId: "frontend_frameworks", front: "What is the Virtual DOM?", back: "The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where a virtual representation of the UI is kept in memory and synced with the 'real' DOM. When a component's state changes, a new VDOM is created, compared with the old one (a process called 'diffing'), and only the necessary changes are applied to the actual DOM, improving performance." },
    { id: "fe_2", deckId: "frontend_frameworks", front: "In React, what is the main difference between state and props?", back: "Props (properties) are read-only and are passed down from a parent component to a child component to communicate data. State is a private, mutable data structure managed within a component that holds data that can change over time, causing the component to re-render when it does." },
    { id: "fe_3", deckId: "frontend_frameworks", front: "What is a component lifecycle in a framework like React or Angular?", back: "A component lifecycle is a sequence of phases a component goes through from its creation (mounting) to its removal from the DOM (unmounting). Developers can tap into these phases using lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount in class components or useEffect in functional React) to run code at specific times." },
    { id: "fe_4", deckId: "frontend_frameworks", front: "Explain what two-way data binding is in a framework like Angular.", back: "Two-way data binding is a mechanism where changes in the UI (e.g., a user typing in an input field) automatically update the underlying component's model (state), and changes in the model automatically update the UI. Angular achieves this with the [(ngModel)] directive." },
    { id: "fe_5", deckId: "frontend_frameworks", front: "What are directives in Angular?", back: "Directives are markers on a DOM element that tell Angular to attach a specific behavior to that element or even transform it and its children. Examples include *ngIf to conditionally add/remove elements and *ngFor to render a list of items." },
    { id: "fe_6", deckId: "frontend_frameworks", front: "What is a primary architectural difference between React and Angular?", back: "React is a library focused only on the view layer, providing flexibility to choose other libraries for state management or routing. Angular is a full-fledged framework that is more opinionated, providing a comprehensive solution out-of-the-box for state management, routing, and HTTP requests." },
    { id: "fe_7", deckId: "frontend_frameworks", front: "What is a 'computed property' in Vue.js?", back: "A computed property is a value that is derived from other data properties. Vue caches computed properties based on their reactive dependencies; they only re-evaluate when a dependency has changed, making them more performant than calling a method in the template." },
    { id: "fe_8", deckId: "frontend_frameworks", front: "How does a React Hook like useEffect work?", back: "The useEffect hook in React functional components allows you to perform side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. It runs after every render by default but can be configured to run only when specific state or props values change." },
    { id: "fe_9", deckId: "frontend_frameworks", front: "How does state management work in a large-scale application?", back: "In large applications, passing state through many layers of components (prop drilling) becomes complex. Libraries like Redux (for React), Vuex (for Vue), or NgRx (for Angular) are used to manage a centralized, global state store that any component can access directly, making state management predictable and easier to debug." },
    { id: "fe_10", deckId: "frontend_frameworks", front: "What is JSX?", back: "JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, commonly used with React. It allows you to write HTML-like code directly within your JavaScript, which is then transpiled into standard React.createElement() calls, making UI code more readable and easier to write." }
