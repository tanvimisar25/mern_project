const initialFlashcardQuestions = [
    { id: "vc_1", deckId: "version_control_deployment", front: "What is the difference between git merge and git rebase?", back: "git merge combines multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. It creates a new 'merge commit' to tie the histories together, preserving the original branches. git rebase re-writes the commit history by moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit, resulting in a linear, cleaner history." },
    { id: "vc_2", deckId: "version_control_deployment", front: "Explain what CI/CD is.", back: "CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.\nCI is the practice of frequently merging all developers' code changes into a central repository, where automated builds and tests are run.\nCD is the practice of automatically releasing the integrated code to a production environment (Deployment) or a production-like environment for manual approval (Delivery)." },
    { id: "vc_3", deckId: "version_control_deployment", front: "What is a 'merge conflict' in Git, and how do you resolve it?", back: "A merge conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. This usually happens when the same lines of code are changed in two different branches that are being merged. To resolve it, you must manually edit the conflicted files to choose the final version, save them, git add the resolved files, and then commit the merge." },
    { id: "vc_4", deckId: "version_control_deployment", front: "What is the difference between git pull and git fetch?", back: "git fetch downloads the latest changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your local working branch. It updates your remote-tracking branches. git pull is a combination of git fetch followed by git merge, meaning it downloads the changes and immediately tries to merge them into your current branch." },
    { id: "vc_5", deckId: "version_control_deployment", front: "What is a container (like Docker), and why is it useful for deployment?", back: "A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: the code, runtime, system tools, and libraries. It's useful because it ensures that the application will run the same way regardless of the environment, solving the 'it works on my machine' problem and making deployments consistent and predictable." },
    { id: "vc_6", deckId: "version_control_deployment", front: "Describe the 'staging area' (or index) in Git.", back: "The staging area is an intermediate area where you can prepare and review commits before they are officially recorded in the repository. After making changes in your working directory, you use the git add command to move those specific changes to the staging area. The git commit command then takes the files from the staging area and saves them as a new commit." },
    { id: "vc_7", deckId: "version_control_deployment", front: "What is a branching strategy, and can you name one?", back: "A branching strategy is a set of rules that developers agree to follow when creating and merging branches in a version control system. It helps to organize work and prevent conflicts. A popular example is GitFlow, which uses a master branch for releases, a develop branch for integrating features, and supporting branches for features, hotfixes, and releases." },
    { id: "vc_8", deckId: "version_control_deployment", front: "Explain the Blue-Green deployment strategy.", back: "Blue-Green deployment is a strategy where you maintain two identical production environments, 'Blue' (the current live version) and 'Green' (the new version). Traffic is routed to Blue until the Green environment is ready and fully tested. Then, the router is switched to send all traffic to the Green environment. This allows for instant rollback (by switching back to Blue) if any issues arise." },
    { id: "vc_9", deckId: "version_control_deployment", front: "What is the difference between cloning and forking a repository?", back: "Cloning creates a local copy of a remote repository on your machine, maintaining a connection to the original repository. Forking creates a new copy of a repository on the server-side (e.g., on your GitHub account). A fork allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and is often used as the first step to contributing to an open-source project." },
    { id: "vc_10", deckId: "version_control_deployment", front: "What is HEAD in Git?", back: "HEAD is a reference or pointer that points to the tip of the currently checked-out branch in your local repository. It essentially represents what your working directory looks like at the moment. When you make a new commit, HEAD moves forward to point to that new commit." }
